# Sensical Model-Based Project

This repository contains the code for a model-based project,for a task related to "Sensical".

## Project Overview

This project implements a model-based approach to solve a specific problem. The core of this repository is the `model.py` which defines the model architecture, and `main.py` which orchestrates the data loading, training, and evaluation processes.

## File Structure

Here is a brief overview of the key files and directories in this repository:

*   **`main.py`**: The main script to run the project. It handles the overall workflow, including data loading, model training, and evaluation.
*   **`model.py`**: This file contains the definition of the machine learning model architecture.
*   **`data_loader.py`**: This script is responsible for loading and preprocessing the data before it is fed into the model.
*   **`config.yaml`**: A configuration file that stores hyperparameters and other settings for the project, allowing for easy modification of experimental parameters.
*   **`utils.py`**: A collection of utility functions that are used across different parts of the project.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: A list of the Python dependencies required to run this project.
*   **`.gitignore`**: A file that specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
